IR Receiver (VCC=3.3V, GND, OUT → GPIO 1 / Arduino pin 1, interrupt)
  - Note: some receiver modules require 5V; if so, level-shift OUT to 3.3V.
  - Known-good unit runs at 3.3V with direct connection (no divider).
Button 1    → GPIO 24
Button 2    → GPIO 6
Buzzer      → GPIO 7
SD CS       → GPIO 23
